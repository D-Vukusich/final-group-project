Attached is a ticket application that uses a Mysql database to store ticket data. Through the ticket application, tickets can be created, read, updated, modified. The user can also use the application to see what ticket is associated with an owner. The ticket shows information that pertains to the date, venue, seat, and barcode for an event. This application was a group project for week 6 of Mysql. The application is pretty standard and user friendly.
