Final group project


Instructions:

Coding Steps:
This week you will be working together as a team to create a full CRUD application.
Your console CRUD application will need to use a database to store all the application data.
As a team, decide what you want your project to do. Get instructor approval early in the week before beginning development.
You need to have at least 3 entities.
Users should be able to interact via the console (i.e. Scanner(System.in)))
Use git to collaborate.
